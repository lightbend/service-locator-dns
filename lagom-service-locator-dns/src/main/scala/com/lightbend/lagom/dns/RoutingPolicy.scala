/**
 * This module and its implementation is from the Consul example provided by J. Boner:
 * https://github.com/jboner/lagom-service-locator-consul
 *
 * The routing policy is not part of the service locator settings in the main project because it may violate
 * the RFC 2782 spec that requires multiple SRV addresses sorted by weight.  In the Lagom service locator, the lookup
 * function requires one result only, and without this fork only the first entry will ever be picked.  This is ok if
 * priority is only determined by weight, but we would like to support round robin as well.
