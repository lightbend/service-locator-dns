service-locator-dns {
  # A list of translators - their order is significant. Translates a service name passed to the
  # service locator into a name that will be used for DNS SRV resolution. Only the first match
  # will be used. This can be easily overridden by providing a SERVICE_LOCATOR_DNS_NAME_TRANSLATORS
  # environment variable.
  #
  # The default translator below should be all that is required for a DC/OS or Mesos/Marathon
  # environment. Kubernetes DNS SRV records take the form:
  #
  #   _my-port-name._my-port-protocol.my-svc.my-namespace.svc.cluster.local
  #
  # ...which implies that your service name should provide the port name. For example with
  # Cassandra where there are typically 3 ports ("native" => 9042, "rpc" => 9160 and "storage" => 7200),
  # your service name might use a hyphen as a delim for the namespace, service name and port name e.g.
  # "customers-cassandra-native". In this case your translator would look like:
  #
  #   "(.*)-(.*)-(.*)" = "_$3._tcp.$2.$1.svc.cluster.local"
  #
  # You may also want to encode the service's protocol into its name given that the caller
  # that is interested in the service location will typically know whether it will be tcp or udp
  # (or anything else). Taking the above example, you might then have "customers-cassandra-native-tcp"
  # and translate these four components.
  #
  # You can of course have multiple translators though and statically declare the translations as
  # your service's configuration (you'll be supplying environment specific configuration quite typically
  # anyway...), and thus keep your service names nice and clean.
  #
  # By default though, we don't translate much i.e. we let it all pass through and put the onus on the
  # client to specify the right service name.

  # the library. The name will initially be looked up (after being passed through name-translators), and then the
  # result will be mapped according to this translation table.
  #
  # For example, this entry will rewrite any queries starting with _api._tcp and ensuring they become _api._http
  #
  # "^_api[.]_tcp[.](.+)$" = "_api.http.$1",
  #
  # By default, we don't transluate i.e. we let it all pass through.
